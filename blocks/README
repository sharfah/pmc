BLOCKS
======

The aim of the game is to clear as many blocks as possible by removing those of the same colour and without letting the grid fill up! 

INSTRUCTIONS: Use the Up/Down arrow keys to move your block and Space to shoot it into a group of blocks with the same colour. If you match four or more colours, the blocks will disappear.
