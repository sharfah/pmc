My Play My Code games.

playmycode.com is a place where you can create your own online games easily using the site's Quby language. The games are compiled into native JavaScript, compatible with all modern HTML5-compliant browsers. Once you've written a game, you can embed it on your website or blog, like I have done below. It's like YouTube, but for games!
